# MERN-TwitterClone Project

Welcome to the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project! This comprehensive guide will walk you through every aspect of this project, including its structure, setup instructions, usage, API endpoints, backend, frontend, contributing guidelines, license information, and how to get in touch for support or inquiries.

## Introduction

This is a Twitter clone project built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It aims to replicate basic functionalities of Twitter, allowing users to post tweets, follow other users, like tweets, and manage their profiles. The project includes authentication, real-time updates, and responsive UI components.


## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, log out functionalities with secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  
- **Tweet Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete tweets. Tweets are displayed in a timeline format.

- **User Interaction**: Users can follow/unfollow other users, like tweets, and view notifications in real-time.

- **Profile Management**: Each user has a profile page showing their tweets, followers, and following users.

- **Real-time Updates**: Used refresh state for real-time notifications of new tweets, likes, and follows.

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes using responsive design principles.
